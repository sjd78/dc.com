<h1><i>Things to do in the Summer</i></h1>

<center><h2>Golfing, Swimming and Boating</h2></center>
<center><h2><font size="+1">(all within 15 minutes of the chalet)</font></h2></center>

Holiday Valley is open in the summer. They have an excellent <i>golf course</i>
and a <i>three pool complex</i>.  <a href="http://www.holidayvalley.com/Summer.cfm?get=5">Click
here to visit Holiday Valley's summer home page</a>.

<p>There are some excellent 18-hole golf courses in the area:
<ul>
  <li>Holiday Valley</li>
  <li>Elkdale</li>
</ul>

Swimming areas are available at:
<ul>
  <li>Holiday Valley - 3-pool complex</li>
  <li>Red House, Allegany State Park</li>
  <li>Quaker Area, Allegany State Park</li>
</ul>

Both motorized and non-motorized boating are also available. Some of the
places where you can go boating are:
<ul>
  <li>Red House, Allegany State Park (non-motorized)</li>
  <li>Kenzua Reservoir (motorized, 35 minutes from the chalet) - 40 miles of
      fully motorized boating.</li>
</ul>

Come on down for a golf weekend, a hiking weekend or a biking weekend -
you will have fun.

<center><h2>Hiking</h2></center>
<center><h2><font size="+1">(5 minutes from the chalet)</font></h2></center>

Some of our favorite things to do year round, and especially in the summer,
are hiking and biking. With Rock City State Forest in our backyard, and
Holiday Valley and Holimont at the top of the hill.&nbsp; There are plenty
of <i>marked trails</i> to follow. In fact, part of the
<a href="http://www.fingerlakes.net/trailsystem/flt2ld.html">Finger Lakes Trail</a>
runs through Little Rock City.

<table CELLSPACING="5">

    <td ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="TOP">

        <center><h3><i>You can start walking with your friends and family, and end up waiting

<p>These pictures were taken on the white trail, part of the Finger Lakes
Trail (FLT), at Little Rock City. This trail takes you down from the rocks
to the CCC camp. The CCC camp is a short walk down the road from the chalet.
At a moderate pace, slow enough so that most of the kids don't fall behind,
it takes about 1 hour to walk down.

<p>Some people have walked up and down the trail, but walking up can be
an unpleasant experience. For most people, driving up to Little Rock City
in your car and then hiking down is the best solution. Getting back to
the car after the hike is the only challenge.

<p>Here are a few links to information on the Finger Lakes Trails

<center><h2>Mountain Biking</h2></center>
<center><h2><font size="+1">(5 minutes from the chalet)</font></h2></center>

The <a href="http://www.wnymba.org">Western New York Mountain Biking Association</a>
(WNYMBA) says that the biking around Ellicottville and Holiday Valley is
some of the best biking around! I would agree. Holiday Valley lets you
bike all over their mountain - as long as you stay off the golf courses.
Holimont is fun to bike around at, and they have a snowmaking pond to cool
off in. WNYMBA has <a href="http://www.wnymba.org/trails/ellicottville.html">detailed
descriptions</a> and maps of the biking around the area. Keep in mind,
the chalet is located on Hungry Hollow Road, not far from the CCC camp.
For mere mortals, the bike ride to the Holiday Valley trails can be a grueling
30 minute ride up hill. I've only done it once - that was enough to make
me decide that driving the car up was more fun.

<center><p><img SRC="biking_dad_tc_scott.jpg" height="259" width="451"></center>

<center><h3><i>Jim, TC and Scott after a morning bike.</i></h3></center>

Some of the trails are easy, some of them are hard. All of them are fun.
Don't forget to pack your tire repair kit for when you hit that rock head
on a little too fast. Don't forget to tell someone where you are going
before you hit the trails and if at all possible, bring communications
(cell phone, TalkAbout, radios etc.) - sometimes you smoke the trails and
sometimes they smoke you.

<p>There are other paved <a href="http://www.wnymba.org/trails/asp.html">biking
trails in Allegany State Park</a>. That bike trip is a little lower on
the adrenaline, and a little higher on the scenery. Biking in Allegany
is something the entire family can do. Allegany is about a 14 minute drive
from the chalet.

<p>A bit further away is Allegheny National Forest. WNYMBA also has
<a href="http://www.wnymba.org/trails/anf.html">trail information</a> for this area.
<p>One more thing, <i>bikes are not allowed on all hiking trails</i>. Check
<a href="http://www.wnymba.org">WNYMBA</a> for some guidelines, or check with officials
at the park you want to bike. Doing this ensures the trails stay open for everyone and
you don't get fined or arrested.

<center><h2><b>Horseback Riding</b></h2></center>
<center><h2><font size="+1">(9 minutes from the chalet)</font></h2></center>

<p>If you are looking for either a fast gallop through the open
fields or a nice easy ride through the countryside, the riding stable has
it all for you. Easy to get to and remember, the hot tub awaits your
arrival back home!!!!

<hr SIZE="1" WIDTH="100%">

<center><h2>Little Rock City</h2></center>
<center><h2><font size="+1">(10 minutes from the chalet)</font></h2></center>

It is something that everyone should see. Rocks the size of houses and
a tree that grows up the side of one. Little Rock City is located in Rock
City State Forest, down the road from the chalet. Little Rock City has
been featured in <a href="http://www.dec.state.ny.us/website/dpae/cons/index.html">The
Conservationist Magazine</a> (although, one of the pictures appears mirrored
to what is actually there). One more word of warning - <i>look down and
make sure you don't fall in the crevasses</i>.

<p><script>document.write("<img src=\"" + p[1] + "\" alt=\"littlerock2\">")</script>
</center>

<p>There are plenty of good photo opportunities. When it is dry out, it
is great fun to run around in between the rocks. Just make sure that everyone
knows where to meet if they get lost. Towards the beginning (or the end)
of the purple trail, there is a tree that is growing up the side of one
of the rocks. We call this &quot;the roots&quot;. Almost everyone who comes to Little
Rock City gets their picture taken by the roots.

<center><p><img SRC="littlerock_roots.gif" height="420" width="250"></center>

<p>If you have a good picture of people by the roots, email it to me
(<a href="mailto:scott@dickersonchalet.com">scott@dickersonchalet.com</a>)
and I'll add it to this page.

<center><h2>Allegany <a href="http://www.nysparks.com/parks">State Park</a>
and <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/allegheny/">National Forest</a></h2></center>
<center><h2><font size="+1">(15 minutes from the chalet)</font></h2></center>

<center><i><font size="+1">&quot;Allegany's mixed hemlock/hardwood forest, mountains,
rolling hills and meadows, streams, ponds and lakes attract devoted outdoors
people year round.&quot; - <a href="http://www.nysparks.com">nysparks.com</a></font></i></center>

<p>The Red House area of Allegany State Park is about a 14 minute drive
from the chalet. Red House has one sand beach for swimming, hiking and
nature trails that do double duty for horseback riding, biking, cross-country
skiing and snowmobiling. In short, if you get bored hiking around the chalet
or in Rock City State, there is lots of hiking to be had here.

<center><p><img SRC="allegheny_view_17.jpg" height="279" width="484"></center>

<center><h4><i>The view of Rt. 17 from the entrance to Allegany State Park</i></h4></center>

You can rent non-motorized boats to play around on the lake at Red House.
We've had a lot of fun on the paddle boats and canoes. They even have a
few water bikes, but we haven't tried those yet. There are also some beach
volleyball courts available.

<p>Both of these pictures were taken overlooking the Red House Lake.

<p><i>Note</i>: There appears the be a number of ways to spell Allegany.
The NYS Parks web site spells it &quot;Allegany&quot;. The national forest is spelled
&quot;Allegheny&quot;. They are two different parks, one state and one federal, with
the same namesake - almost. So, don't get aggravated if you see Allegany
spelled in different ways.
